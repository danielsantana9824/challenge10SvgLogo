## Challenge 10: Shape Geometry Generator

## Description
This project automates the creation of shapes using various geometric forms. It provides a simple yet powerful tool to generate shapes based on user-defined parameters, making the process of creating and manipulating geometric forms more efficient.

## Motivation:
The main motivation behind this project was to enhance my understanding of geometry and improve my proficiency in object-oriented programming (OOP) through automating the generation of geometric shapes. The goal was to streamline the process of working with geometric patterns and shapes.

## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to automate the creation of geometric shapes. This simplifies the task of generating complex designs, allowing users to create visually appealing shapes without needing advanced mathematical tools or manually designing each shape.

## Problem Solved:
This project eliminates the need for manual calculations or complex tools to create geometric shapes. By automating the process, it saves time and ensures that the shapes are created with precision, making it ideal for projects that require flexibility in design and manipulation of geometric patterns.

## Lessons Learned:
I improved my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) while working with geometric shapes and patterns. This project allowed me to refine my ability to build reusable code components for generating and manipulating geometric forms, while also deepening my understanding of mathematical structures in programming.
